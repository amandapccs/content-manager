<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

The Content Rating API is a backend service built with Node and Fastify, which can be run locally or via Docker. A complete CRUD system has been created for content/post management, including user registration and login endpoints, as well as endpoints for rating posts on a scale from 1 to 5.
<br />


Note: All endpoints are protected except for login and registration, requiring a JWT token to be passed in requests.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The API can be run locally or using Docker. If you're running locally, you'll need a MongoDB connection string. This step can be skipped if using Docker, as it will create three containers: a MongoDB container, a testing container to run all unit tests, and finally, the container running the API.

### Installation

#### Running with Docker

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:amandapccs/content-manager.git
   ```
2. Run the command:
   ```sh
   docker compose up
   ```
3. The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000/`

#### Rodando localmente

1. Clone o reposit√≥rio
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:amandapccs/content-manager.git
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the root of the repository with the "MONGO" variable using your MongoDB connection string.
3. Install dependencies with the command:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the application
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000/`
